            <h2>Evolution of the Soulslike Genre</h2>
            <div class="timeline">
                <p>The Soulslike subgenre went from a mad scientist lab experiment to one of the biggest gaming divinities. This all started with, the original, Demon's Souls (2009), where FromSoft built a foundation of punishing gameplay and an immersive narrative style that would change the face of action RPGs. This successful formula would be refined in the case of Dark Souls (2011), with interconnected world design and a slow, deliberate combat system that became the trademarks of this genre.</p>
                
                <p>But, as the genre grew up, every new release pushed its limits. Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III (2016) established the fundamental pillars of the experience, and Bloodborne (2015) showed that the formula could carry over to new settings and combat systems. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019) had taken that even further with its emphasis on rhythm and precision, proving that the Soulslike framework could accommodate a variety of playstyles.</p>
                
                <p>The changes in Elden Ring (2022) were the most ambitious so far. By translating the Soulslike experience into an open world without sacrificing the difficult encounters and environmental storytelling at the heart of the genre. Its unusually widespread success brought these design tenets to their widest audience to date. Through this evolution, the essential philosophy of meaningful difficulty, rewarding exploration, and cryptic storytelling that respects player intelligence remains unchanged.</p>

            <h2>Games That Defined the Genre</h2>
            <h3>FromSoft Masterpieces</h3>
            <div class="game-grid">
                <div class="game-card">
                    <img src="images/darkSoulsTril.jpg" alt="Dark Souls Trilogy">
                    <div class="game-content">
                        <h4 class="game-title">Dark Souls Trilogy</h4>
                        <p>The trilogy that defined the genre set a template that thousands of games were to co-opt. Its world design was interconnected, creating exploration that felt like solving a three-dimensional puzzle, and its approach to storytelling – fracturing narrative within a description of time and within the details of the environment – imbued it with a form of player engagement entirely new to games, where making sense of a world became, in effect, a community effort.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="game-card">
                    <img src="images/bloodborne.jpg" alt="Bloodborne">
                    <div class="game-content">
                        <h4 class="game-title">Bloodborne</h4>
                        <p>The Victorian Gothic setting and horror aspects of Bloodborne changed the Soulslike formula. Its rally system — where players regained health by counterattacking immediately after taking damage — promoted a more aggressive style of play that went against Souls' careful, methodical approach. The nightmarish design and cloying atmosphere forced an unforgettable experience that many hold as FromSoft's artistic zenith.</p>

                </div>

                    <div class="game-content">
                        <h4 class="game-title">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h4>
                        <p>Sekiro was a drastic change with its emphasis on one hero, not character customization. Its posture system emphasized shattering an enemy's stance instead of whittling down health, and it created a rhythm-based combat experience that felt like an elaborate choreography. Expanded tactical options enhanced mobility and stealth mechanics, and a resurrection mechanic added strategic depth to death itself.</p>

                        <h4 class="game-title">Elden Ring</h4>
                        <p>Elden Ring managed to bring the Soulslike formula into an open world and keep its core tenets intact. The freedom it afforded players felt a natural expansion of the exploration-based gameplay that had characterized the series, while Legacy Dungeons gave the firm's level design a return on investment for the designer's labor: they were lovingly crafted spaces that could be recreated in a full environment.</p>

                        <h4 class="game-title">Nioh Series (Team Ninja)</h4>
                        <p>Team Ninja's series took the Soulslike formula into feudal Japan, where a stance-based combat system introduced new levels of complexity. Its Guardian Spirits and yokai abilities formed one of the most technically deep action systems in the genre.</p>

                        <h4 class="game-title">Lies of P (Neowiz & Round8 Studios)</h4>
                        <p>This grim re-interpretation of Pinocchio moved the formula into a Belle Epoque setting the steampunk aesthetics. Its weapon customization system offered unprecedented build variety, while its fable-inspired narrative offered a stronger take on the genre's traditionally thin storytelling.</p>

                        <h4 class="game-title">Salt and Sanctuary (Ska Studios)</h4>
                        <p>This 2D side-scrolling take on Soulslike principles showed how they could work in a different viewpoint, adhering closely to the stamina-based combat, punishing difficulty, and interconnected world design that defined the genre.</p>

                        <h4 class="game-title">Black Myth: Wukong (Game Science)</h4>
                        <p>Inspired by Chinese mythology, the beautiful Black Myth: Wukong fused Soulslike combat with the types of brightly decorated visuals that generally eschew the gloom of the genre. Its fluid combat system and transformation mechanics added welcome cultural diversity to the game.</p>

                        <p>Respawn Entertainment successfully brought Soulslike mechanics over into the Star Wars universe and provided an accessible entry point for new players. Its commercial success proved the mainstream potential of these mechanics when they were thoughtfully ported.</p>
